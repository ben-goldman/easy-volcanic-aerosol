# compile_eva_template

# Author: Matthew Toohey (matthew.toohey@usask.ca)
# Last update, October 2022
#
# This file contains a template script that can be used to compile EVA once the path to the directory containing the FORTRAN NETCDF libraries is given, as well as the compilation flags appropriate for the system.
# Note also that appropriate modules may need to be loaded before running this compilation script, e.g., gcc and netcdf-fortran
# One way to use this file would be to copy it to a new file, named 'compile_eva_<machine>', with the name of  your machine inserted, then edit this file with the 
# appropriate NETCDF and FLAGS variables, then make the script executable and run it to compile the EVA routines
